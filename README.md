# solid_flutter_local_01

## About Project:
This project is built on the basic Flutter template code along with the basic test accompanied with it. It uses the test code both as normal tests as integration tests through the flutter test driver. It includes a GitHub Actions workflow that performs the necessary steps to run the test code both as normal tests and integration tests, in Chrome on a Ubuntu runner, as part of the workflow in the runner environment.

## Reflections:
Very simple project. Consolidates the core understanding of testing and integration testing I have gained in experimental projects in the past few weeks.

## Notable (Milestone) Resources Created:
- Boilerplate Flutter driver code
- Boilerplate GH Actions workflow to set up Flutter
- Boilerplate GH Actions workflow to run integration tests for Flutter in Chrome on Ubuntu.
- Precedent for skill consolidation/validation project READMEs (as well as projects that spearhead minor skill aquisitions)
